Run demoRecon.m
ProjectionDataPath is the projection storage path

Sometimes, because the version problem, you have to rerun the compiling again in your matlab. Please check the script named like "compile*.m" in each sub-folder and run it in your matlab.

Please contact liurui1217@gmail.com if you have problem to compile the mex files. The subtitle of the email should begin with "GitHub-AnalyticalRecon compiling problem ..." Thank you
